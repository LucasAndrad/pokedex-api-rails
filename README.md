# README

This is Pokemon API in Rails.

I made this API only to study and to help people to study.

It's a ruby back-end with a cool data to study all those new JavaScript frameworks, so you can use to create a Pokedex, or even a rpg game in React, Agular, Vue, React Native and etc. It's nice for study and also for teach kids.

## License

The API and the data has different licenses.
The API is what I created ans it's under MIT license, so can use as you want with any database of your responsibility.

If you want to use with the data of this project be aware that you should only use it for studies. You may not use it for any commercial proposal or any other activity that violates Nitendo's copyright.
